# CS2323 Lab-3: RISC-V Disassembler
Submission by Edward Nathan Varghese - CS22BTECH11020

-> The source code is **disassembler.cpp**.

-> Compile it with **g++ disassembler.cpp** and run it with **./a.out**

-> The input has to be given in **input.txt** and output is generated in **output.txt**

> Note: Required header files are **iostream**, **fstream**, **vector**, **map** and **string**. Input is expected to contain '\n' delimited 8-length hexadecimals and the code may produce erroneous results if input format is not followed correctly.

-> Some testcases have been included in **testcases.txt** along with their expected outputs

-> Report of the assignment has also been written
